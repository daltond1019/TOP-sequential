//Greet the user

console.log('Hello. Would you like to play a game?')

//Instruct the user on protocol. You can enter rock, paper, or scissors as plain text.
//Make it case insensetive.

//After you prompt for input but before recieving it generate but don't print rock,
//paper, or scissors. Probably with a random number generator and some loops. If the
//number is 0-0.3 its rock if its 0.34-0.66 its paper, if its 0.67-1 its scissors. 
//Store the result.

//Take the input from the user (as a function?) and compare it to the returned 
//random result. Proabably need to do nested if statements for each input from the 
//user and each result or vice versa. There should be a more elegant way to do it. 
//I can't think of one now.

//print the results.
